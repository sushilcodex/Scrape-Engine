The equity rally continues

Source: LSEG Datastream

The S&P 500 reached its all-time high on 19 February – just three months ago. Since then, the market has been on a wild ride. The S&P 500 dropped nearly 8% between Inauguration Day and ‘Liberation Day’ (2 April).

When ‘Liberation Day’ came along, the confusing announcement of tariffs on every country America trades with – with rates varying between punitive and catastrophic – was taken poorly. The S&P 500 lost a further 12% of its value. Other global markets did better but still reacted negatively to the news.

Since then, U.S. President Donald Trump has announced the deferment of the most painful individual tariff rates, causing a sharp rally. China was hit with effective embargo tariff rates of 145% and the promise of additional curbs on the semiconductor supply chain, but a sharp decline in this tariff rate was announced last week.

President Trump now plans to overhaul the broad ‘AI diffusion rule’ implemented under former President Biden. The rule organises countries into three tiers, which all have different restrictions on whether advanced AI chips can be exported to the country without a licence. It seems that he plans on replacing it with individual deals negotiated with countries, however, the use of Chinese technology such as Huawei’s Ascend AI chips could prevent such agreements.

President Trump has been negotiating chips sale agreements with some Middle Eastern countries. The semiconductor deal-making continues to drive a huge rally in related stocks, which has been aided by the general equity rally and change in tone on trade.

All this leaves the U.S. equity market 4% above its ‘Liberation Day’ level, and just 4% away from a new all-time high.

Foreign exchange markets have seen less relief. Since Inauguration Day, the U.S. dollar has slipped 5%. Since ‘Capitulation Day’ (when President Trump deferred the higher individual tariff rates by 90 days), it has rallied 2%.

Investors shouldn’t forget the reasons for a widely-held overweight position to U.S. stocks. Some U.S. companies are exceptional and offer unparalleled access to the technology and AI-enabled changes that will transform the economy over a few years. But they should remain aware of the damage done to America’s reputation as a trading partner. Investors will rethink allocations to U.S. assets, while reserve managers will rethink the need to hold U.S. debt. Small changes here can have big implications.

This cocktail could allow the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, but for now, it will want to see more evidence of modest inflationary pressures.

Trump trades are reversing

In addition to the above, other fallout from ‘Liberation Day’ has been dispersing. A hot topic is gold, which has shown signs of slipping following two failed attempts to decisively breach $3,400 per ounce.

A mellowing trade war is bad news for gold, but the seemingly intact trend of diversifying away from the U.S. remains supportive. After the enormous rise, a consolidation seems healthy.

Last week, bonds benefitted from the ebbing of inflation concerns due to reduced tariffs. The picture is very complicated with regards to U.S. treasuries, as they must balance worse inflation and worse growth. In addition to this and the potential reduced demand from overseas buyers, there’s also the prospect of changes in bond issuance.

The U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means (the Committee), which is responsible for writing tax law, released draft legislation last week. Although not all these proposals will become law – final legislation needs to be approved by Congress before going to the president to sign – it’s worth looking at what’s contained in this blueprint. By far, the costliest part of the tax package is the ten-year extension of the individual rate reductions, which are set to expire this year.

The Committee also included President Trump’s unorthodox tax cut promises of no tax on tips and no tax on overtime in the draft – but these are planned to last for only four years. President Trump had also promised to end taxes on Social Security benefits, but this has instead provided for a so-called ‘enhanced deduction’ for seniors on top of the regular tax deduction. The proposal also calls for no tax on car loan interest.

To offset the costs, the plan proposes reducing the state and local tax (SALT) deduction limit, which is currently capped at $10,000. Some Republicans from high-tax areas are likely to push back, as they favour higher deductions. The plan also eliminates several clean energy tax credits introduced under President Biden, including the $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit. Notably, it retains the current top tax rate of 37%, contrary to President Trump’s recent suggestion to raise it to 39.6% for those earning over $2.5 million annually.

Overall, the plan increased the deficit by $3.7trn over a decade. It could be bolstered if the administration can restrict Medicaid coverage, and there will be benefits to the Treasury from funds raised by tariffs, but they’re not scored because they’re emergency measures rather than legislative ones.

Similarly, savings through the Department of Government Efficiency will reduce federal costs, but as the funds being saved have already been approved by the government, the administration is theoretically required to spend them. If these savings can be made to stick, that can be considered in future appropriations.

The outlook for U.S. fiscal policy is far from clear three months into the Trump administration’s mandate, and the quick win it sought continues to look elusive.

The economy remains robust

Source: LSEG Datastream

Is the U.S. economy reflecting the extreme pessimism from consumers? Yes, to an extent.

Retail sales growth was muted but hardly collapsed. There was weakness in some sectors, particularly those affected by Chinese tariffs which, prior to their relaxation, had been acting as an embargo rather than a tax.

Audio equipment and electronics saw sharp increases in prices when Consumer Price Index (CPI) data was released. Audio equipment prices rose almost 9% in a month, which was easily the highest increase going back to the beginning of the data series in 2009.

Retail sales data showed a slight increase in spending on electronics, which suggests that people have bought fewer goods for more money. In other categories, inventories are still masking the impact of measures. At a headline level, weak services prices – reflecting caution from U.S. consumers – are holding prices down.

Coming up this week

UK inflation: CPI and Retail Prince Index (RPI) data are released on Wednesday. Sadly, prices will lurch upwards due to increases in utilities bills. These increases in non-discretionary spending can sap discretionary spending and are therefore difficult to interpret for the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee. If there’s weakness in other categories, it may still enable further cuts.

Purchasing managers indices: A further health check on the corporate sector around the world seems set to remain downbeat – particularly with regard to the manufacturing sector. But are services maintaining momentum?

Key highlights

Tariff escalation: A 10% tariff will apply to all countries, but trading partners like China, Japan and Europe will face rates two and three times as high.

Impact felt globally: The tariffs are an effort to boost U.S. manufacturing and address trade imbalances, but there are fears they will hike consumer prices, disrupt global supply chains, and lead to trade wars.

Stocks see red: Equity markets around the world fell into the red, but the impact on companies is complex and varies stock by stock, depending on where firms manufacture their goods.

What has happened?

After weeks of anticipation and speculation, President Donald Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ announcement unveiled trade measures toward the more extreme end of expectations. We’ll avoid reprising what is widely available in the press, but it’s worth a quick reminder of the background behind Wednesday’s executive order.

Early in his second term, President Trump ordered the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to investigate potential trade frictions imposed by America’s trading partners, aiming to identify instances where their exports to the U.S. gained an unfair advantage over U.S. exports. He requested a thorough review into not only tariffs, but also non-tariff barriers.

Despite decades of progress in reducing tariffs and trade barriers, there remain frictions, and to some extent these are inevitable.

What has been announced?

At the end of March, the USTR’s report, the 2025 National Trade Estimate, highlighted a seemingly global trend: every country exerts protectionist policies. However, the report did not measure the effect of these policies. Instead, it assumed an effective tariff rate which was based upon how large that country’s trade surplus with the U.S. was. Bizarrely, for countries with no trade surplus, or even a trade deficit, the effective tariff rate was assumed to be 10%.

As a result, the U.S. is implementing so-called reciprocal measures.

Specifically, the U.S. will fully reciprocate the 10% effective tariff imposed by 115 countries on U.S. imports. For 75 countries with effective tariffs exceeding 10%, the U.S. will partially reciprocate with tariffs ranging from 10% to 50%.

These tariffs follow the metal imports tariffs President Trump introduced during his first term. This year, he’s raised tariffs on China three times, resulting in a cumulative rate of more than 60% since the start of his first term. This includes tariffs related to fentanyl imports, which also apply to Canada and Mexico. Additionally, sector specific tariffs of 25% have been announced on U.S. imports of steel, aluminium, cars, and car parts. The impact of the tariffs is considerable. During these first months of his second term, the average tariff on U.S. imports has risen by around 20%. And President Trump isn’t stopping there; he’s indicated that further tariffs are planned to cover pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber, and copper.

‘Liberation Day’ tariffs were mostly at a flat rate of 10% or half of the effective tariff estimated by the U.S. Trade Representative.

How will this affect the economy?

Best estimates indicate these tariffs could reduce U.S. GDP by as much as 3%, but we can assume a lot of this will be mitigated by recycling the tax revenue from tariffs back into the economy. When the Congressional Budget Office forecasts the sustainability of tax cuts, we don’t believe they’ll be able to include this revenue given the tariffs were imposed under emergency, rather than permanent, legislation. Nevertheless, we assume this tax revenue will somehow be fed back into the economy, which will partially offset the pain of these measures. U.S. GDP is now only expected to grow by around 1% over the next year, although the risks are to the downside.

The impact on prices is harder to mitigate, so inflation may be 1% to 1.5% higher as a result.

Ordinarily, we would expect currency appreciation from the country imposing a tariff (as fewer dollars get exchanged for foreign currency to buy imports). It’s therefore striking that the dollar has fallen sharply since it became clear President Trump would implement tariffs on countries simultaneously. This reflects the fact that U.S. growth is expected to suffer more than the growth of its trading partners.

The U.S. can expect higher taxes and prices relative to its trade, and will also face retaliatory measures; China has already announced additional tariffs of 34% on U.S. imports. Comparatively, trading partners will only suffer this in relation to their trade with the U.S.

The effective tax increase and price increase will reduce U.S. GDP. Retaliation could  make this worse, tax cuts could lessen the impact.

The Federal Reserve will probably cut U.S. interest rates this year, although with inflation potentially breaching 4% during 2025, it won’t be an easy decision, especially with the weak dollar. In Europe, the European Central Bank and Bank of England are quite likely to cut interest rates at their next meeting

How will tariffs impact the UK?

It’s a peculiar reflection of the situation that the UK, which does not run a meaningful trade surplus with the U.S., can be considered to have escaped the wrath of President Trump’s administration by only suffering a 10% tariff on exports to the U.S. In reality, however, the direct impact of these measures seems likely to be modest, not least because competing producers will be in a similar or worse position. The indirect effects are much harder to model. At the time of writing, the UK government has hinted at retaliation but stopped short of declaring it.

Will tariffs be successful in reducing the U.S. trade deficit?

To some extent they will, but historically the U.S. trade deficit has contracted at times when the U.S. economy has slowed, so it could seem like a pyrrhic victory.

The reason the U.S. runs a trade deficit is because American consumers spend more than they save, a situation made possible by the Federal government spending more than it collects in tax revenue. Interestingly, while the tariffs are substantial, they probably aren’t enough for exports from most emerging economies to become uncompetitive relative to U.S. manufacturing.

U.S. productive capacity is insufficient to meet its domestic demand, and that situation will only worsen due to immigration curbs. Without immigration, America’s working age population is projected to start declining. Therefore, it seems unlikely that these policies will spark the manufacturing revolution President Trump is trying to achieve.

How will investments be impacted?

Markets have been bracing themselves for this announcement for weeks. Now that it’s landed, it has proven to be towards the more extreme end of what investors considered possible, and that has weighed on markets.

From an equities perspective, the impact on companies is complex and varies stock by stock. The impact doesn’t depend on where companies’ shares are listed, or even where they sell their goods, but rather where they manufacture their goods.

Notably, the Magnificent Seven – the mega-cap, U.S. technology-enabled companies – have seen a pullback in their exceptional gains. While most don’t appear directly exposed to tariffs, rising uncertainty often leads investors to take profits. Tariffs on Vietnam will hit Apple though (down 9% after the announcement), which stands out as the epitome of U.S. exceptionalism, as well as Nike (down 14%).

Following two years of strong stock market returns, this period of volatility reminds us why investors need defensive assets within their portfolios. Gold has provided good protection, though investors are currently taking profits, probably because they knew gold was exempted from tariffs. Tight corporate spreads leave credit vulnerable if the world is going to experience a growth shock, so we recommend an underweight position, while our overweight position in sovereign bonds should benefit.

What happens next?

Above all, the two key truths about President Trump have been reinforced and remain as relevant now as ever:

He firmly believes in tariffs as a tool to empower U.S. industry

He loves to negotiate

There’s no question that these tariffs negatively impact the global economy. While trade has environmental and social consequences, its overall economic effect is positive, and curtailing it creates a headwind.

There is hope yet, though.

As mentioned, countries with net exports to the U.S. are assumed to be imposing protectionist policies, whereas countries with net U.S. imports are also being hit by U.S. protectionism. This double standard might seem outrageous, but in reality, any country is free to impose whatever trade restriction it wants on another country, as long as it’s prepared to live with the consequences. Therefore, this situation bears all the hallmarks of an outlandish opening gambit from an arch dealmaker.

President Trump has already signalled his willingness to negotiate, and the unpopularity of additional price rises should encourage him to do so. In his book, The Art of the Deal, he says “I always go in with a very low offer, and I always assume that the other side will negotiate. I believe that the other side will want to make a deal, and I’m willing to negotiate.”

It therefore seems likely that we’ll see a reduction in these tariff rates, and they’ll probably be announced with great fanfare.

https://www.brewin.co.uk/insights/uk-spring-statement-2025-what-it-means-for-your-money,UK Spring Statement 2025 Highlights: What it means for your money,N/A,"26 March 2025 | 7 minute read

UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has unveiled the 2025 UK Spring Statement, aiming to balance public finances and “secure Britain’s future in a world changing before our eyes”.

The Spring Statement follows a significant Autumn Budget, in which tax rises totalling £40 billion were announced. Despite a shifting geopolitical scene since that announcement, the Chancellor is resolute in reserving major fiscal decisions to once annually in the autumn, leading to a restrained Spring Statement that zeroed in on expenditure reductions and a boost in defence spending.

Our analysis examines the Spring Statement’s relatively limited measures affecting personal wealth and investments, with Guy Foster, chief strategist, evaluating the UK’s economic prospects in light of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)’s projections.

Financial planning highlights: Spring statement tax rises eschewed in favour of tacking tax avoidance and evasion.

Status quo maintained for national insurance, capital gains and inheritance tax

The Chancellor’s Spring Statement eschewed further tax rises, maintaining the status quo on income, capital gains, inheritance tax (IHT), VAT, and National Insurance.

Instead, there was a heavy focus on enhancing HMRC’s debt management, targeting promoters of tax avoidance, and intensifying efforts to clamp down on tax evasion. This includes action to prosecute more tax fraudsters, reform the rewards for informants, increase penalties, and tackle advisers facilitating non-compliance.

Looking ahead, the UK’s substantial debt burden and limited fiscal leeway mean that expectations for a more lenient personal tax regime in the upcoming budget are muted. Meanwhile, the current stability in tax legislation provides a window for individuals to review their financial planning strategies in anticipation of possible changes in autumn. Engaging with your wealth planner and professional advisers can help you understand what options are available to you.

Business Relief

Business owners face an increased IHT liability starting April 2026 due to a previously announced £1 million cap on relief. However, a recent HMRC consultation suggested there could be the potential to benefit from the £1 million allowance multiple times.

Any gifts of Business Relief assets between 30 October 2024 and 5 April 2026 will count towards the £1 million allowance, with the reset period for Agricultural and Business Relief set at every seven years from the date of each gift of the assets. It’s important to note that Business Relief investment allowances cannot be shared between spouses, which differs from some other IHT allowances.

With careful planning considering existing IHT strategies, business owners could benefit several times by making multiple gifts on a rolling seven-year basis. Note that it’s vital to consider the suitability of the alternative investment market or other schemes for IHT planning, considering how Business Relief assets are divided between spouses and their eventual distribution upon death. Keeping detailed records of all Business Relief assets transferred since 30 October 2024 is imperative. Currently, this area remains without draft legislation and consultation continues.

The outlook for the UK economy

In the autumn, the government announced significant tax hikes and increased borrowing to fund major investments in public services. The Spring Statement would ideally be an update on how those policies were affecting the economy.

Firstly, it’s important to remember that the government must abide by rules which limit how much it can borrow in the future. These rules are designed to prevent governments from being tempted to take risks now, which could have significant costs later. The OBR’s role is to estimate whether the government abides by these rules.

For the Chancellor, the most challenging thing is to ensure that the current budget (that means day-to-day spending but does not restrict investment) is on course to be in balance by the 2029/30 financial year. At the last budget, the OBR estimated that the government would meet this restriction by £9.9bn — although such forecasts are inherently uncertain.

Ideally, chancellors would like more margin for error, or scope to spend. As it turns out, the forecast has deteriorated due to a combination of weaker economic growth and higher interest rates, leaving the government on course to break its fiscal rules.

This has led to a series of pre-Spring Statement announcements, including welfare reductions and public sector efficiency measures. However, the government intends to increase borrowing, but to use more of that money to invest, particularly in defence.

Whilst few would doubt the necessity of investing in defence, it doesn’t help the Chancellor meet her fiscal rules. For each pound invested in defence, the additional economic activity is relatively modest. By contrast, housebuilding generates a lot of additional economic activity, which is why promising to reduce planning hurdles can improve growth overall, despite carrying no fiscal cost.

UK spring statement household finances

The net result is that despite the deterioration in revenue growth assumptions, the OBR judgement once again predicts that the Chancellor will meet her current spending rule at £9.9bn. If that number seems familiar it’s because it restores exactly the same headroom the Chancellor had last autumn.

Clearly £9.9bn is better than nothing, but the last few months have shown just how easy it is for economic performance to change and for perceived headroom to disappear. So far, most of the current parliament has seen a constant debate over whether tax increases and spending cuts might be required, and retaining this modest headroom invites that to continue. The real risk is that this uncertainty leads to companies feeling too unsure to invest. This is particularly relevant given the existing economic uncertainty that stems from the new U.S. government and its plans to introduce an uncertain range of tariffs.

At a time when the economic outlook is even more uncertain than normal, the Chancellor would ideally have more margin for error.

The other nuance about the fiscal rules is that they allow for the government to meet its targets by forecasting austere measures in the coming years. We share some scepticism about the extent to which spending growth will slow in some departments as the current parliamentary term concludes.

The fiscal rules are just one constraint that the government is under. The other, arguably more meaningful constraint, is the bond market reaction.

Market reaction to spring statement

If governments are expected to borrow more money or if their actions are expected to boost inflation, then the cost of issuing new government debt will rise. With relatively few announcements made in the Spring Statement, and with recent days having seen reductions in welfare costs, the bond market has been relatively stable. This has been helped by the news indicating that UK inflation slowed slightly during February.

Overall, the Chancellor has reiterated the government’s commitment to its manifesto pledge against raising core personal taxes, taking a more cautious approach after earlier bond market jitters.

Much will now depend on how the economy fares between now and autumn’s budget.

Key highlights

Volatility, the new norm: President Trump’s toing and froing on the implementation of tariffs is causing market turbulence and anxiety. This is making it harder to predict economic conditions and is having far-reaching implications for investors and businesses alike.

Trade tensions rise: Tariffs are being used to protect domestic industries, but this tactic risks triggering trade wars, inflation, and slower global growth. This uncertainty makes it harder to predict how investments will fare in the short term.

Diversification is key: A globally diverse portfolio can provide a buffer against U.S.-centric market drops, helping to mitigate the risks associated with single policy-driven downturns.

Patience and perspective: Uncertainty typically resolves through policy changes or economic adaptation. Investors must stay grounded, informed, and focused on the long game. By avoiding knee-jerk decisions and staying the course, investors can capitalise on opportunities that arise during times of turmoil.

It’s safe to say that the start of President Trump’s second term has ushered in a new era of uncertainty, upending global markets and fuelling fears of a global trade war.

Unsurprisingly, uncertainty causes volatility and this can feel deeply unsettling. However, the reason investments grow wealth faster than bank savings is because investors are willing and able to tolerate these periods of volatility.

Every period of market anxiety is unique, but they always present opportunities for those who remain calm and thoughtful, and risks for those driven by emotions.

With your trust and our team’s experience of navigating decades of investment cycles, we can help turn volatility to your advantage.

Let’s break down what’s happening and what investors can do to navigate the turbulence.

(Re)introducing tariffs

The latest market anxiety stems from a new U.S. administration challenging decades of economic orthodoxy, reintroducing the archaic policy tool of tariffs to achieve vague and opaque policy objectives.

Tariffs have a long history, but for the last half a century, significant efforts have been made to reduce them. That changed with President Trump’s first term, and he seems keen to continue his tariff ‘love affair’ in his second term. But why would anyone want to impose tariffs?

Tariffs are a tax on imported goods, and their purpose is to raise revenue and/or protect domestic businesses. Today, tariffs are more commonly used for the latter.

Agriculture is a good example. If it’s cheaper to produce food abroad, a tariff can help domestic producers to compete by making imported food more expensive. This protects jobs and boosts resilience. A country that relies heavily on imported food becomes vulnerable to trade disruptions.

Tariffs were the major source of U.S. government revenue at the start of the twentieth century. However, by the new millennium they had largely been eliminated as part of a global push to dismantle trade barriers. So, why the shift?

Economists realised that more global trade can be mutually beneficial. This process, known as globalisation, enables countries to specialise in the things they excel at, leading to lower prices and consequently, higher living standards.

However, globalisation has become a contentious issue in recent years due to several concerns. Firstly, income inequality has increased. As economies globalise, some become skills and services-based, leaving fewer opportunities for unskilled labour. There’s also a desire to protect nationally important industries (such as agriculture and defence) and to preserve different countries’ cultural identities, which can be diluted by an influx of globally popular products.

Despite these concerns, the push for tariff reduction continued until 2016 when it was placed under threat by the election of President Trump.

President Trump has since revived tariffs as a critical policy tool, seeing it as a way to reduce America’s trade deficit. A large trade deficit suggests American’s have been ceding jobs to their trading partners. The counter argument is that most Americans have enjoyed lower prices and higher paid jobs because of the specialisation made possible by international trade.

That argument will continue, but what matters for now is what the U.S. president believes and can act upon. The world is now bracing for them and trying to anticipate their severity.

How do tariffs impact investments?

Tariffs affect the economy, and the economy affects investments. Let’s break it down.

The most obvious impact of a tariff is inflation. A tariff is a tax on imported goods, and its purpose is to raise prices so that imports are more expensive relative to domestically produced goods.

If the U.S. increases tariffs on its trading partners, those partners are likely to retaliate with their own tariffs. This creates a situation of escalating tariffs that can harm economic growth.

We’ve seen this play out in recent events.

In February, President Trump originally tried to impose tariffs on the U.S.’s largest trading partners, Canada and Mexico, but ultimately decided to defer that decision for a month at the eleventh hour. March arrived and when he did impose the tariffs, they were met with resistance from American automakers who rely on imported car parts. As a result, the tariffs were watered down.

President Trump also imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. This could be problematic because Canada has a natural advantage in the production of steel due to its high-quality mineral reserves and ability to harness cheaper hydroelectric power to mill the steel. Imposing a tariff on Canadian steel imports therefore raises costs for U.S. manufacturers.

In response to the protestation of automakers, President Trump temporarily reduced tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico. He’s also promised further reciprocal tariffs on other countries following reviews by the U.S. Trade Representative into all tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade.

This approach has sparked debate, with some within the administration arguing that even valued-added taxes (VAT) could be considered trade barriers, despite applying evenly to imports and domestic goods — a claim that contradicts the practice in 175 countries where VAT is standard.

What’s Trump’s next move?

The main concern for businesses and investors is that it’s difficult to understand how far President Trump is willing to push tariffs. The recent stream of announcements has been nothing short of chaotic, with tariffs being announced, deferred, doubled, and sometimes even reduced in a matter of hours.

At the heart of this debate is whether tariffs are a long-term policy tool or a short-term negotiating tactic. Our best guess is that he sees a role for both, adding to the uncertainty and complexity of the situation.

What does this uncertainty mean for investors?

The stock market has been shaken by the prospect of tariffs, and this has been driven by two key concerns.

Firstly, investors doubted President Trump’s willingness to inflict so much harm on his own economy. Secondly, the growing unease among businesses and consumers about the uncertain policy environment has added to the market’s jitters.

Despite the potential inflationary impact of tariffs, investors have become increasingly concerned about their effect on the U.S. economy’s growth prospects. This is reflected in falling interest rate expectations, indicating that investors believe the tariffs’ effects on growth are likely to be more significant than any inflationary pressures.

In this context, it’s natural to wonder what this means for investors. The answer lies in being prepared for a range of outcomes, from a recession to a swift recovery.

Under recessionary conditions, bonds outperform, and equities are volatile. Government bonds outperform corporate bonds and at current valuations, it’s sensible to hold defensive bonds.

However, a U.S. recession is by no means a certainty. The U.S. government could yet reverse this ill-founded policy as fast as it instigated it, providing an opportunity for sentiment to quickly recover.

Our portfolios are geographically diversified, which reduced some of the impact of recent volatility in the U.S. stock market. Much of those declines can be attributed to the weakness of a small group of megacap stocks, which have driven the U.S. stock market’s substantial gains in recent years.

Should we be worried about these declines?

In short, probably not. Some of these megacap stocks are undoubtedly among the most valuable business franchises in history, with unparalleled access to the data, infrastructure and distribution that will shape the global economy. Notably, many of these companies are among those least directly impacted by tariffs, suggesting recent declines may be driven by investors taking profits after a remarkable run.

The value of patience and perspective

There’s no question that the current environment is an unusually uncertain one. But experience has shown that such uncertainty, which has so far weighed on some stocks, can be fleeting. In this scenario, panic sellers tend to lose out, as they typically do in volatile periods.

Ultimately, uncertainty will resolve itself, either through the economy adapting to new policies, or through the reversal of policies if they fail to meet their objectives.

In times like these, we’re reminded that bad investment decisions often stem from volatile emotions rather than volatile markets.

So, while we won’t be swinging for the fences until conditions improve, opportunities will emerge, and we’ll be ready to take them. That’s because we’ve weathered many similar periods in the past, always seeing fresh, promising opportunities emerge that will help us grow in the long term.

With snakes symbolising renewal, agility and resilience in Chinese culture, Head of Market Analysis Janet Mui explores why the Year of the Snake is a critical period for China as it tackles economic challenges, technological advancements, and global competition.

A common saying has it that when China sneezes, the world catches a cold. As the world’s second largest economy, largest exporter, and largest commodity importer, its direct impact on the global economy has been significant over the past few decades. But is this influence set to change? Let’s take a look…

China’s prospects in the Year of the Snake

2025 is set to be a symbolic milestone for Chinese ambition and national pride.

Ten years ago, China unveiled a comprehensive industrial strategy named ‘Made in China 2025’ that aimed to transform China from a low-value manufacturing hub to the global leader in cutting-edge technology and innovation.

Fast forward to 2025 and China has largely succeeded – from its dominance in solar panels, electric vehicles and drones, to its advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), most recently through AI disruptor DeepSeek.

‘Made in China 2025’ has proven successful despite U.S. export restrictions, cementing China’s status as a leading strategic rival to the U.S. Now with the acceleration of AI development, the Year of the Snake presents an opportunity for China to evaluate its progress and set new goals for growth.

That said, China faces its challenges, most notably a deflating housing bubble. However, the country’s strong technological dividends – already integrated and enjoyed in everyday life – and its robust national infrastructure, provide a solid foundation for new growth drivers to emerge.

China’s challenges are wrapped in complexity

First, China must uncoil a complex set of challenges. These are both cyclical and structural, as well as domestic and international.

Domestic property

The elephant in the room is the struggling property sector, which has depressed investment and suppressed consumer confidence. Deflation (when prices keep going down) is a threat due to oversupply and a reluctance to spend, as people wait for prices to drop further. The housing market has a significant impact on confidence because if prices rise, owners tend to have more confidence to spend. While home prices and sales declines have stabilised, a sustained reduction in home inventory will take time. Demographic trends, such as a fall in household formation, also pose a long-term challenge to demand.

Consumer confidence

Critical to China’s renewal is confidence, particularly in the economy and job security – the latter being key to unlocking near-term spending power. However, young people face a tough jobs market and rising job insecurity, which threatens their income stability and reduces their desire to start families. This trend is underscored by the government’s decision to stop publishing youth unemployment data and the spread of the ‘lie flat’ attitude on social media; this involves young people putting in minimal effort at work.

Although the Chinese have great potential spending power due to a high savings rate, a reluctance to spend persists amidst falling property prices and economic uncertainty. Research from the People’s Bank of China has indeed shown an increased desire to save.1

Tariffs

China must also contend with prominent external challenges, such as U.S. President Donald Trump’s imposition of additional 10% tariffs on Chinese products. The potential escalation in trade tensions between China and the U.S. will pose risks to China, but the threat may also prompt it to confront its domestic structural challenges head-on.

The complexity of these challenges demands patience. Despite government stimulus, it’s perhaps wishful thinking that things will turn rosy solely due to that. The view is that there needs to be some bolder and more creative fiscal policies in the Year of the Snake to harness growth and boost the confidence of businesses, consumers, and markets.

How will China untangle itself?

Just as snakes adapt to their surroundings, so must China’s policymakers, who will need to be agile in response to the shifting economic landscape.

A China-U.S. trade war could be damaging, but it could also hasten China’s shift towards a growth model that prioritises domestic consumption over a reliance on exports and investment.

China’s long-standing growth model of fixed investment via infrastructure and property is showing diminishing returns and is unsustainable. While the latest government stimulus package improves the supply and price of credit, the fundamental problem is inefficient capital allocation and risk aversion.

The Chinese authorities have long advocated for a shift in growth priorities to consumption, whose share in GDP (gross domestic product) remains much lower than other major economies. However, China’s cultural emphasis on saving and its limited social safety net, along with a lack of domestic investment options, has contributed to its high savings rate.

The government’s current consumption support policies have focused on subsidies for upgrades like new white goods or electric vehicles, with limited success. New plans announced at the end of 2024 aim to provide more direct support to families with multiple children and those struggling with extreme poverty. However, markets remain unimpressed at the scale of these measures.

Amidst the crosscurrent of domestic and external headwinds, the risk of rising unemployment is high. The rapid pace of AI development and potential labour displacement could exacerbate uncertainty, threatening social stability and consumer confidence. This perfect storm of challenges may serve as a catalyst for China to take bold action.

Can the Chinese market get its bite back?

The tentative recovery of Chinese equity markets in 2024 was driven by stimulus. In 2025, markets will be looking for the right type of stimulus, like that boosting household consumption, and the recovery in economic data. A less aggressive tone from President Trump will also enable a more sustainable rebound. There’s a fair, but not high, probability that all of these may happen.

The Chinese equity market offers cheap valuations, making it an attractive diversifier against the U.S. market. As AI development progresses in China, investors may revive interest in Chinese tech companies that were previously battered by regulatory concerns. Although any potential upside should be balanced against the unpredictable regulatory and political risks.

As for Chinese government bonds, yields have slumped to record lows due to deflation risks and economic concerns. If the economy improves, yields should edge up in 2025. The Chinese authorities are also wary of potential volatility in the financial system, warning institutions not to over-invest in Chinese government bonds.

China may also allow for a more competitive exchange rate, but it will proceed with caution in managing the yuan’s depreciation, given the macroeconomic and trade risks.

How does China’s economy impact the UK?

As we’ve seen, China faces its challenges, and given the size of its economy, this could impact global markets, including the UK. Or perhaps not?

As China shifts towards self-sufficiency and less commodity-intensive growth, its direct impact on the world will wane in comparison to the last few decades.

Interestingly, despite negative sentiment on China, developed markets’ equity indices have performed well, with a few exceptions.

A return to confidence in China could boost global markets, particularly European equities. For example, Chinese activity drives some of the largest stocks in the EURO STOXX 50 index, such as consumer discretionary and industrial stocks.

For the UK, China’s data typically influences mining stocks, given China is the world’s largest industrial commodity importer. This relationship will likely hold, if not weaken slightly, as the driver of Chinese growth shifts more towards consumption from investment.

Selected UK banks, like HSBC, are also exposed to China. A large share of HSBC’s profits is derived from Chinese markets, and its exposure to the Chinese real estate sector is a source of concern for investors.2

However, the UK is limited in its direct economic exposure to China, with only 5% of UK exports going to the country. For context, the UK actually exports more to Ireland than to China. This probably explains why the UK chancellor is keen to strengthen dialogue with Chinese officials and explore more bilateral trade opportunities.

Despite the UK’s limited direct exports to China, the country’s supply chains are highly interconnected with those of China. As a result, any shocks in China’s economy are likely to have an impact on UK manufacturers, particularly those in the automotive industry.

From lurking to striking in the AI race

Despite economic and domestic headwinds, the Chinese have a proven track record of innovation and adaptation. Today, it regularly boasts the highest number of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) PhD graduates each year.3 Together with bold stimulus action, it will be this innovation that helps steer China through its challenges.

China’s tech capabilities saw a ground-breaking AI development, DeepSeek, introduced at the turn of the Chinese New Year. The Chinese AI start-up has developed a robust open-source AI model at a fraction of the cost used to train its Western equivalent, ChatGPT. Its model also requires significantly less computing power to operate, making it a more efficient and cost-effective solution.

While the economics of DeepSeek have yet to be verified, the innovative technique to improve efficiency in training and inference has been applauded by top technology companies, including ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. DeepSeek’s unveiling has been a revelation in the global AI race, which begs the question, how did it happen?

Ultimately, China’s deprivation of high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) due to U.S. export controls forced Chinese AI developers to work with limited resources and constraints. This led to accelerated innovation and cost efficiency.

A year of several skins?

In the Year of the Snake, we can anticipate further reports on technological breakthroughs and transformations emerging from China’s robust ecosystem. This includes its strong STEM pool, vast data resources, extensive industrial facilities, and a culture characterised by determination, adaptability, and a rich history of innovation. Investors will undoubtedly keep a close watch on these attributes and developments.

Overall, the Year of the Snake is poised to be a time of renewal and agility for China, with potential for positive effects to ripple out to the global community.

https://www.brewin.co.uk/insights/what-can-investors-expect-from-trump-2-0,What can investors expect from Trump 2.0?,N/A,"27 January 2025 | 9 minute read

The President Trump reboot has well and truly arrived. We may be just a few days in, but the implications for the global economy and investors are already starting to take shape.

As we navigate this new landscape and a flurry of executive orders are signed, it’s first worth remembering what powers the president has and how he might like to wield them.

The power of the President

As President, Trump leads the executive branch of government, which is responsible for enforcing laws. Congress writes those laws, although in modern times, the President has a significant influence over their drafting. If Congress drafts a law without the President’s input, he can veto it.

This separation of powers checks the President’s power. However, Trump’s Republican Party controls Congress and in his first term he also gained significant influence over the third branch of government, the judiciary (courts), therefore reducing the check’s effectiveness.

The President also uses executive orders, instructions from the President to a federal agency to undertake a specific action. Unlike laws passed by Congress, executive orders can’t spend money or change taxes, but do offer Presidents significant power over non-budgetary matters.

These arrangements haven’t changed since President Trump’s first presidency. What has changed is his team…

Team Trump unites

There is a greater cohesion at the start of this Trump presidency. In 2017, members of his own team sought to water down or delay some of his initiatives. In 2025, the Trump administration seems to be pulling in the same direction.

But what is that direction?

Since the election, the three main categories the administration has been targeting have remained broadly the same.

Trump and taxes

Policy direction

Trump’s first term saw sweeping tax cuts across personal and corporate taxes, some of which are due to expire during 2026. Given he campaigned on a pledge to lower taxes for this election, his priority will be to ensure that those existing cuts are made permanent or extended. He may even try to cut taxes further, particularly for companies producing goods in the U.S.

The reality

As mentioned, these budgetary processes need to pass through Congress, which will probably feel compelled to rollover existing tax cuts. One major obstacle to further tax cuts is the U.S.’s substantial budget deficit, which stood at over $1.8 trillion for the 2024 financial year and took U.S. national debt to over $35 trillion. Given this challenge, achieving additional tax cuts appears to be a difficult goal.

The impact

If taxes can be cut, it could encourage consumers to spend more, which would bolster U.S. growth. Typically, this would lead to increased employment. However, with low unemployment there’s limited scope for this, so tax cuts might instead lead to inflation. Considering these factors, the most likely outcome seems to be a continuation of existing tax cuts, with only minor additional cuts. Whatever the decision, it will likely take weeks if not months of negotiation.

On his other goals, President Trump has been able to act faster…

Trump and immigration

Policy direction

Trump has been outspoken about the need to rein in immigration and has also discussed deporting millions of unauthorised migrants (estimates assume there are over 11 million in total).

The reality

Trump has already taken several steps to reduce the number of immigrants and prepare to deport unauthorised migrants. Much of this has been achieved through executive order, but legislation passed through Congress within days, requiring the detention of migrants suspected of crimes, even if they haven’t been charged. This legislation was passed swiftly because it was supported by some Democrats. Ultimately, President Trump’s efforts in this area are likely to continue.

The impact

There is undoubtedly a substantial human cost associated with deporting unauthorised migrants, one that should be deeply considered. It will also come at a significant monetary cost and pose considerable logistical challenges. However, the greatest economic concern is that a substantial reduction in workers could risk causing inflation, particularly in sectors with high immigrant workforces, such as agriculture.

Allowing immigration policy to drive a significant increase in food prices due to a shortage of workers would be a substantial own goal. This concern is just one reason why the administration is likely to fall short of its unauthorised migrant deportation targets.

Trump and tariffs

Policy direction

One of Trump’s key objectives is to win benefits for America by imposing taxes on imports (tariffs).

The reality

President Trump immediately ordered a series of investigations which are a precursor to imposing tariffs. On his first day in office, he claimed 25% tariffs would be imposed on Canada and Mexico by 1 February 2025.

Tariffs serve multiple purposes within Trump’s world. In his first term, tariffs on Chinese imports aimed to reduce imports from a strategic rival, with debatable success. Alternatively, Trump has used tariffs as bargaining chips to renegotiate trade agreements, as demonstrated against Mexico and Canada in his previous term. So, tariffs can be threats, temporary measures, or structural impediments to trade.

The impact

The direct economic impact of tariffs is to discourage trade. This means in the first instance, it’s likely to reduce economic activity for net exporters and increase it for net importers. This has been reflected in stronger U.S. economic growth expectations for the U.S. relative to other regions.

Tariffs will also increase prices. A price increase is inflationary, but only for imported goods. Typically, this effect is temporary as tariffs are a one-off increase in cost. Tariffs may be charged on imports, but those higher prices are paid for by consumers and, with inflation high on voters’ priority lists, excessive use of tariffs could be unpopular.

Generally, if one country imposes tariffs, the target of those measures will impose countervailing (retaliatory) tariffs. So far, countries have been cautious about responding to Trump’s threats, waiting for a clearer sense of what will be enacted and what is mere rhetoric. For the UK, it’s unlikely to be a major target of the Trump administration’s trade policies given its trade deficit with the U.S.

In a speech to the World Economic Forum last week, Trump also complained about European sales, or value added, taxes. These are often seen as barriers to trade, as imports are subject to the local sales tax, while exports aren’t. The interactions between VAT and trade are complex, and research has cast doubt on the intuitive belief that VAT enhances export competitiveness. However, Trump is an intuitive individual and may threaten tariffs until European sales taxes are dropped. This might seem like a welcome outcome for UK consumers, but like all taxes, if VAT was cut, something else would need to rise to replace lost revenue.

What about deregulation?

Underlying the President’s agenda is a broad thrust of deregulation, including environmental policy. This aims to ease investment in the U.S. and boost American economic capacity.

The President has ordered Federal waters to be made available for oil drilling, which could add to U.S. growth and help to moderate inflation. Meanwhile, Trump has once again ordered that the U.S. withdraws from the Paris Climate Agreement.

Perhaps the biggest surprise of the new Trump administration has been the announcement of a major investment in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, led by U.S. firm OpenAI and backed by Japanese firm Softbank and Abu Dhabi’s AI investment fund. The U.S. government is not funding the project but is clearing regulatory hurdles for the deal, which is valued at up to $500bn.

A new era of uncertainty?

In the weeks leading up to and following President Trump’s election victory, financial markets anticipated higher inflation, and the early days of his presidency have done little to dispel this expectation.

Trump’s economic policies aim to stimulate growth through deregulation and tax reform. However, this growth may come at the expense of other regions due to the implementation of tariffs.

The upshot is that U.S. stocks or companies exposed to the U.S. economy are likely to enjoy the thrust of the new government’s policies more than other regions (perhaps unsurprisingly). According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), among advanced economies, the U.S. is stronger than previously projected on continued strength in domestic demand. The IMF raised its growth projection for the U.S. this year by 0.5%, to 2.7%, as a result.

However, overly vigorous immigration policy and tariff enforcement could potentially restrict economic growth or exacerbate inflationary pressures. In this context, the President’s repeated threats to influence interest rate policy have been unsettling to bond markets. For now, this has resulted in higher yields than those seen in the months preceding the election, making them attractive to investors. Nevertheless, just how fast and loose President Trump is willing to play with inflation will need to be monitored closely.

While most actions taken so far align with pre-election expectations, the early days of the administration have not resolved many of the uncertainties either.

During 2024, company shares were the best performing major asset class. Commodity prices rose, while bonds underwhelmed.

One of the major themes of the year was the strength of the U.S. economy. American households continued to spend, beginning the year with high cash balances from Covid payouts and ending it with higher incomes and reduced travel expenses.

Economic performance outside the U.S. was distinctly mixed.

China, for example, did not emerge in early 2024 from its Covid lockdown with the same economic vigour that developed countries did. The Chinese government has attempted to wean the economy off real estate investment as a driver of growth. Typically, periods of lacklustre economic growth could be perked up by encouraging more construction. State banks would ensure households had the means to pay for new properties, and there was plenty of demand because Chinese households had relatively few alternatives to invest their savings into. Unfortunately, this led to too many properties being built and, with low occupancy, prices started to fall. In stark contrast to America, China’s economy has been weak, with consumers at the heart of that weakness.

In the UK, its economy grew at a modest pace. It ended 2023 in a shallow recession and entered 2024 with an election in prospect. Household spending edged up as taxes were cut and the long shadow of utility bill increases began to lift.

Like many European economies, the post-Covid period has been difficult for the UK, imposing a heavy cost in terms of energy security and government debt. Replacing Russian energy supplies has been costly, with households bearing the brunt of high inflation. The combined impact of Covid and subsequent inflation has resulted higher government borrowing costs.

Democracies change their lead

The economic situation has brought significant political challenges, too. In a year in which over 100 countries (accounting for half the world’s population) held elections, voters dismissed most of the incumbent governments.

Inflation made households much worse off, and governments were unable to help. That’s mainly because their finances were stretched, but even if they hadn’t been, extra government spending would risk fuelling inflation anyway – an impossible bind.

Over the final quarter of the year, the new UK Labour government announced its budget. Unperturbed by high borrowing and high tax rates, the chancellor looked to tax and borrow even more to improve the standard of public services. In the view of the Office of Budgetary Responsibility (OBR), this will increase inflationary pressure and so won’t increase economic growth much. If inflationary pressures increase, it will be difficult for the Bank of England to cut interest rates much. Just two cuts are currently expected for 2025.

Snap elections in Europe

Although French President Emmanuel Macron’s term in office is not due to end until 2027, he triggered early legislative elections in July, as his popularity has waned. After no party achieved a majority, it took until September for Michel Barnier to be appointed as prime minister. However, his minority government lasted only until the beginning of December due to unpopular tax increases and spending cuts needed to bring France’s budget within European Union borrowing limits. As the year ended, new Prime Minister, Francois Bayrou had formed a new government and was attempting to agree a budget.

Over the border in Germany, Chancellor Olaf Scholz triggered early elections as his three-party coalition government (centre-left Social Democratic Party, centrist Free Democratic Party, and centre-left the Greens) were unable to agree on economic policies. The elections will take place in February, with the centre-right Union party alliance currently far ahead in the polls, although still short of a majority, with the further-right Alternative for Deutschland in second place.

America plays the Trump card

All this European political drama will struggle for prominence in the history books relative to November’s U.S. elections.

President-elect Donald Trump’s victory came in addition to his Republican Party retaining control of the U.S. House of Representatives and capturing a Senate majority. This so-called sweep of the White House and both chambers of U.S. Congress theoretically leaves the Republicans in a strong position to pass and enact legislation. The nuance is that the majority in the House is just four seats. This means they need virtual unanimity to be assured of passing legislation. A series of failed votes in the days before Christmas to extend federal funding and avoid a government shutdown showed just how difficult it’s going to be to achieve the unanimity required.

Despite such challenges, the election result was cheered by the stock market and bemoaned by the bond market in anticipation of policies which may favour U.S. growth.

What could these policies look like?

It’s widely assumed that a Republican Congress will cut taxes. However, as the U.S. federal budget deficit (the amount by which borrowing increases) ran to nearly to $1.8 trillion last year, cutting taxes would seem difficult to justify for anyone who considers themselves fiscally conservative.

A fiscal wildcard?

Spending cuts would be one way to slow the pace of borrowing in the U.S. How will those be achieved? Enter Tesla founder Elon Musk, who Trump has appointed as one of the chairs of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which will look to cut “at least $2 trillion” from U.S. government spending by eradicating “waste”. However, there’s much scepticism about how effective this is likely to be.

More tangible is the belief that the regulatory environment will be lighter under a second Trump presidency. A principal beneficiary of this would be U.S. banks, which performed strongly in the weeks surrounding the election and rose to high valuations to become one of the best performing sectors of 2024.

The other strong performers of the year were technology and communication services. However, these sector definitions obscure a group of companies perceived to benefit from the increased roll-out of artificial intelligence (AI) through their access to data, their data processing capabilities, or because they provide the semiconductors that form the brain matter of AI.

At the other end of the spectrum, the nomination of Robert F Kennedy Jr as Secretary of Health and Human Services weighed on healthcare stocks due to his outspoken scepticism over vaccines.

Gold had a strong year, although its ascent stalled a little after the election. Gold has limited supply and therefore contrasts with fiat currency (government-issued currency that isn’t backed by a commodity such as gold) or government bonds, both of which have seen substantially increased supply in recent years.

Although gold doesn’t provide the income stream that bonds do, its low supply and historical association with wealth can make it seem attractive. These limited supply characteristics are also found in Bitcoin, which enjoyed a boost towards the end of the year as Trump, who once described Bitcoin as a scam, seems more disposed to it now. There is, however, a seemingly limitless array of other cryptocurrencies that somewhat challenges the idea of “limited” supply.

A loaded deck

The positive stock market reaction to President-elect Trump’s victory seems to imply that he will increase economic growth. This is something many economists are sceptical of. They argue that several policies (tariffs, immigration restrictions and deportations), if they were practical, would weigh on economic growth over the long term. But inevitably, many of his campaign pledges might not be delivered, as was the case in his first term. The most deliverable element is the easier regulatory environment, which requires little input from Congress, so this is the one the market is focused on.

As a new year begins, we have an idea of what the new president and Congress will be hoping to achieve, we just don’t know what they’ll manage. Because as those who know politics say:

“Politicians can’t manage. All they can do is talk.” – Donald Trump, 45th President and President-elect of the United States

This year was always going to be a watershed for global politics, with around half the world’s population poised to vote.

The last quarter began with the UK election, and it ends with just a month to go until the U.S. elections, which for investors is surely the most keenly observed of them all.

A new UK government takes charge

Whilst the U.S. election remains extremely tight, the UK saw a landslide. Labour won a majority of 174 seats, their largest in a quarter of a century. This extraordinary haul was achieved with a relatively modest 33.7% of the vote, reflecting general disillusionment with the traditional two-party political system. More than 40% of votes went to other parties, signalling that a shift in the political landscape is afoot.

With this mandate the new government has a tremendous opportunity to pass legislation and change the country. Yet it could be argued that during the campaign, Labour was defined as much by what it wouldn’t do, than any bold choices it plans to make.

The new government inherits an economy which is growing at a reasonable pace. In 2024, many major economies would envy that of the UK. However, Britain’s economic leadership partly reflects its emergence from a recession during 2023 and some tax cuts made by the former government in an attempt to curry favour with the electorate. A budget has been scheduled for 30 October, which offers an opportunity for the government to alter current fiscal plans, which imply higher taxes and deep spending cuts for many departments. Some measures introduced soon after the election have cut spending already, which have proven to be unpopular.

Misplaced messages

The UK government began laying the groundwork for the upcoming budget from election day onwards, relentlessly emphasising the “hard choices” that will need to be made.

Sentiment has slid back since the election and if households were to spend less or businesses invest less, then that economic doom-mongering could become a self-fulfilling prophecy. A growing economy brings in more tax revenue and can therefore support more spending than a relatively static one.

Perhaps recognising this, there was a slight change of tone at the Labour Party Conference in September. Although the government seem determined to remain within the fiscal straitjacket which it set itself during the election campaign (promising not to increase taxes on income, companies and spending), there was a suggestion it might allow borrowing for investment, a move that could be crucial if executed wisely.

Gloom builds overseas

The UK’s relative economic success comes against a backdrop of uncertainty overseas.

Germany may have slipped into a third quarter recession, driven by two main factors: its dependence on cheap Russian gas, which is now no longer available, and the decline of its auto industry, which has struggled to compete with more competitive Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers.

Like the UK, France also installed a new government. However, far from a huge majority, the new French government is backed by a minority of the National Assembly. And this is in a country renowned for its willingness to take to the streets to oppose tough choices made by even the most popular of leaders. France’s public borrowing is also particularly concerning.

Across the Atlantic, the U.S. economy remains reasonably robust. There has been a slight slowdown in consumer activity during the summer months and the previous shortages of employees seem to have eased. The question now remains, is the economy sliding into recession, or having overheated during the last two years, is it now returning to a state of harmonious balance?

Losing interest…

Over the third quarter, interest rates fell in the Eurozone, UK, and U.S. The latter’s move generated particular interest due to its economic influence and an unusually large half a percentage point cut by the Federal Reserve in September.

Although the U.S. economy is slowing rather than slumping, policy makers are likely to continue cutting interests rates gradually, with rates likely to fall below 3% in the UK and U.S., and maybe as low as 1% in the Eurozone.

Japan has bucked the trend, with inflation returning after nearly three decades of falling prices. This has allowed the central bank to edge interest rates into positive territory, and a further increase is possible but likely modest as inflation will slow next year.

Eastern uprising

The very end of September saw China launch a stimulus package that eclipsed the efforts of Western economies. The measures included making it easier for banks to lend; an interest rate cut that made borrowing cheaper for consumers; and the option for households to renegotiate existing fixed-rate mortgages.

However, one of the main challenges facing the Chinese economy is its dependence upon property as a store of household wealth. Declining property values have left many households in negative equity, making them less likely to borrow and spend. This reduced demand is further exacerbated by developers’ reluctance to start new projects due to the falling values.

The prescription for this kind of economic malaise is for the government demand to pick up the shortfall in private sector borrowing. The Ministry of Finance is rumoured to be preparing a significant fiscal support package, which includes subsidies for upgrades to existing consumer goods and a payment per child for families having more than one child. This could provide a boost to consumer spending and help address China’s demographic challenges.

The stock market rallied on the back of these stimulus measures, particularly the announcement of a swap programme that allows institutional holders of risky assets to swap them with the central bank and receive liquidity in return. However, the key question is, how long can these fiscal stimulus measures be expected to last? Without a firm commitment, the impact may be temporary, but if the government can convince the public that the payments will continue, it could bring about a more sustained change in behaviour.

What can we expect for the remainder of 2024?

The next quarter will include the U.S. elections and during the last quarter there was a lot of drama. President Biden dropped out of the race and former President Trump survived two assassination attempts.

At the end of the quarter, Vice President Kamala Harris held a slim lead in polling, and an even more marginal lead in the critical swing states. The race for the White House is simply too close to call.

The investment implications of the U.S. election are complex. They depend not just on the presidency, but also on which candidate’s party will control Congress, which determines law-making and taxation. There is a significant chance these organs of government will be divided between the parties, making policy changes difficult.

Events in the Middle East have, of course, been concerning in many ways. Yet their economic impact remains relatively contained, with limited oil production disruption. However, oil prices did rise towards the end of the quarter as the chances of a broader conflict increased.

That risk is offset by rising oil supply and low Chinese demand, which has impacted prices and helped to curb inflation and boost household disposable income around the world. This dynamic has enabled the global economy to navigate high interest rates and demand fluctuations without a significant recession (so far), despite initial fears.

Like many developed economies, the UK is facing challenges in raising the revenue its government needs to spend. Two key figures illustrate the problem, and they require some explanation.

Imagine your personal finances. You earn a steady income and try to keep your spending below it. If you overspend, you will become overdrawn.

The UK government faces a similar situation. It needs to balance its spending with tax revenue. When tax revenue falls short, the government borrows money, creating what’s called a budget deficit (around £120bn last year). This is like the amount by which the overdraft increases each year. The total overdraft, or accumulated deficits, is the national debt (now roughly £2.7tn).

These enormous numbers are hard to comprehend so we tend to express them as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). GDP is the value of the total economic activity in a country. Think of it as the total income of all workers, landlords and businesses within an economy. This is a crude measure of things the government could tax.

The budget deficit in the 2023/24 financial year was around 4.4% of GDP[1] and the national debt as a share of GDP was just under 100%[2] in July 2024. But how do we know whether these are good, bad or indifferent numbers?

Will the country go bust?

Although we began by comparing household finances to public finances, for most major economies similarities are limited. When household debt rises, it can become unsustainable, leading to default and bankruptcy. For the UK, the chance of this seems remote.

In contrast, the government has discretion in setting tax rates to meet spending needs. Moreover, it creates the currency it uses. In extremes, the government can find pounds to meet public spending if it wants to, even if it had to resort to “printing” it.

While excessive government debt is a concern, it’s more likely to manifest as currency devaluation or inflation, which might need to be countered by rising interest rates. This affects savers, as inflation erodes the value of their savings.

Accumulating debt also increases the amount of interest the nation must pay, making it difficult to avoid further debt.

Are tough choices really required?

The UK government faces tough decisions, but there’s nuance to consider.

The government sensibly constrains itself by the fiscal rule that requires debt as a share of GDP to fall by the end of the Office of Budget Responsibility’s (OBR) five-year forecast period. Fortunately, the government is on track to meet this target.

However, there’s a catch.

Every year there’s a new final year of the forecast period. It’s possible to meet the rule by always expecting to cut borrowing in five years, while increasing borrowing in the current year. “Lord, give me chastity and continence, but not yet!” as Saint Augustine says in his confessions.

For example, the OBR has noted that the government has consistently frozen fuel duty rates since 2011, despite previously planned increases. This has resulted in a significant deviation from the original fiscal plans.

Additionally, the forecasts restrict spending growth, while protecting certain departments like health, education and defence. This implies sharp reductions in spending on other departments, like transport and justice, which many consider implausible.

Is there a third way?

It seems then that some hard choices will be taken, but a third path may exist.

While it’s assumed it’ll increase taxation and could potentially cut spending, the government could focus on increasing potential GDP.

Increasing GDP without changing tax rates produces more revenue. To some extent this formed part of the approach taken by Liz Truss during her brief premiership. Whilst that doesn’t bode well as it caused a sharp increase in interest rates, the current economic context is different.

Firstly, the economy was operating at or beyond full employment back then, meaning that attempts to stimulate the economy were more likely to trigger inflation than growth. Currently, there’s perhaps more scope for non-inflationary growth.

Secondly, the current government has taken steps to demonstrate fiscal responsibility, building back confidence in the UK’s economic credibility following the 2022 ‘mini-budget’ under Liz Truss. This may afford Labour more license to borrow and spend wisely.

In this context, the government could consider adjusting the fiscal rules to exclude investment spending. This could boost taxable economic activity in the future, rather than being constrained by a current rule that doesn’t differentiate between current spending and investment spending (2.6 percentage points of the UK’s 4.4% budget deficit reflected investment spending last year)[3].

But what kind of projects won’t go ahead because of this restriction? Well, it limits the ability of departments to invest in systems and infrastructure which might increase efficiency and reduce cost in the future. Every governmental department could benefit from investment in its physical digital resources to help staff work efficiently.

So far, the government has seemed committed to abiding by the previous administration’s fiscal rules, which may not be the most effective approach. A more relaxed attitude towards investment expenditure, combined with a more demanding rule on current expenditure, might be a more suitable strategy.

If the deficit must be reduced, how can the government do it?

The government has added to its fiscal constraints by promising not to raise certain taxes, including income tax, corporation tax, National Insurance (NI) and VAT, as per its manifesto. It has also discussed not raising taxes on working people, a phrase which is as ambiguous as it is meaningful.

Where could the government look?

As we age, many of us rely on our pensions to provide a comfortable retirement. However, the UK’s pension system is complex and has been criticised for being unfair and inefficient. The government is considering reforms to make it more sustainable and equitable, but all proposals have either economic or political costs.

Pensions are costly for any serving government because they offer tax relief on contributions (public cost) now, but then charge tax on withdrawals (public revenue) in the distant future. One proposal is to restrict up-front income tax relief to the basic rate of income tax or a flat rate of income tax for all. George Osborne even suggested making pensions like ISAs, with no tax relief on contributions but tax-free withdrawals.

The political appeal is clear, but incomplete tax relief would effectively mean higher earners would pay tax on both contributions and withdrawals, which seems a perverse disincentive to save for retirement.

The pension tax-free lump sum benefit could be limited to a fixed amount, reducing its benefit, particularly to wealth investors. However, this approach could be unfair to savers who have planned their finances based on this payment.

Could NI be applied to pensions?

Currently employer pension contributions and pension income are free of National Insurance Contributions (NICs) (both employer and employee). These tax efficiencies could be targeted by the government, raising questions about its manifesto commitment to not raise NI.

To avoid undermining the public trust in pensions, fundamental reforms of the type discussed above could require savers to differentiate between their existing pensions and new pensions, contributed to on different terms. This would create more complexity.

Because of these challenges, some of the most significant reforms to pensions have been additional freedoms on the use of proceeds, but more tellingly, restrictions on the amount that can be contributed and the total size of the pension pot. A compensatory increase in the ISA allowance has led savers to accumulate wealth in tax-free ISAs, which will mean less taxable income as people start drawing from their ISAs.

ISAs have also taken on more importance for funding retirement because a huge benefit of saving into pensions comes from the fact that bequeathed pension wealth does not form part of the investors’ estate. For example, if a saver dies before 75, their pension can be inherited with no further tax due on the income.

Removing these benefits would create revenue for the public finances, but at a cost. Many families might find themselves better off accumulating wealth in other tax-free wrappers, rather than their pensions. This would be a difficult political decision for the government – taxes on inherited wealth are a divisive and unpopular concept.

The same dilemma would arise if the chancellor was to remove the exemption from capital gains tax (CGT) on death.

Is capital gains tax the obvious golden goose?

CGT has been the focus of much speculation about raising tax revenues.

The Labour Party see CGT as a way to redistribute income, but also recognises the importance of not discouraging investment through excessive tax on capital gains. Raising CGT rates to match income tax rates would effectively close the fiscal hole, but the numbers don’t tell the full story.

CGT is a tax that affords the payer some discretion over whether to sell an asset and trigger a liability. Therefore, if tax rates rise sharply, there would be a reduction in transactions, significantly decreasing revenue.

How significant would this be?

According to government estimates, equalising the tax rates would actually decrease revenue significantly rather than increasing it. There are plenty of other reasons why the government should be wary of increasing CGT rates sharply, but that seems the most compelling.

Of course, that effect could be temporarily overridden by signalling the change in enough time to prompt a rush of liquidations from investors getting ahead of the change, providing a short-lived boost to the public finances.

Could the chancellor’s refusal to rule out a CGT increase be an act of subtle coercion? Maybe, or perhaps that’s just wishful thinking!

Maintaining frozen thresholds

A final means of increasing tax take is to continue freezing allowances. This is essentially how the previous government were able to increase the tax burden whilst not increasing tax rates. This approach allows tax rates to remain steady while incomes grow, causing taxpayers to naturally move into higher income categories and be subject to higher tax rates – a move that wouldn’t breach manifesto promises.

Pre-Halloween pain ahead?

We don’t know how the new government will raise new tax revenue, but it seems almost certain it will. There are a lot of different ways it could do so, and there’s an overarching desire to make the tax system simpler and easier to understand.

However, it seems wishful thinking that the Budget won’t add to the complexity, as governments try to make their acts of generosity more obvious than their acts of austerity.

A Labour government has the keys to 10 Downing Street and control of the House of Commons for the first time since 2010, with party leader Sir Keir Starmer becoming the UK’s new prime minister.

Will Labour increase taxes?

With the aim to grow the economy and “keep taxes, inflation and mortgages as low as possible,” Starmer’s Labour manifesto places an emphasis on wealth creation. To fulfil those plans, Labour may have to make changes that could affect taxes, allowances, and various investment schemes and rules.

Doing so may prove challenging with the pledges made in the manifesto. Leading think tank, the Institute for Government, claim Labour’s spending plans appear to exceed the amount of anticipated new revenue, and the Institute for Fiscal Studies stated “how it will square the circle in government we do not know.”1

Although the manifesto is not legally binding, it offers the best indication of what Labour’s plans for government are. Here we highlight what the pledges could mean for your personal finances and the potential impact of a Labour government on financial markets.

Inheritance tax (IHT)

IHT has been widely discussed in recent months and was a noticeable absentee from the Labour manifesto. It contained no comments on the future of IHT rates or reliefs (such as Business Relief and Agricultural Property Relief).

Income tax

While Labour has pledged not to increase taxes on working people (including income tax at the basic, higher and additional rates) this does not preclude utilising fiscal drag to increase income tax revenues. Fiscal drag occurs when inflation and income growth push taxpayers into higher tax brackets, which already remain frozen until at least 2028. This policy results in higher taxes for affected individuals, even though the tax rates themselves have not changed.

One area to watch could be taxes on dividend income. These have not been mentioned and may be outside the scope of the pledge as a non-working source of income with its own income tax rates. Moreover, Labour has pledged to reform the taxation of carried interest, which is a share of profits from a private equity, venture capital or hedge fund. The manifesto does not set out exactly how Labour would close the carried interest ‘loophole’, but the intent is clear, stating, “private equity is the only industry where performance-related pay is treated as capital gains. Labour will close this loophole”2

Capital gains tax (CGT)

The Labour manifesto did not specifically mention CGT rates, and the party’s senior figures, including leader Sir Keir Starmer, have said that they have no plans to reform these rates – with the exception of their proposed policy on carried interest. That said, future increases have not been ruled out entirely.

What Sir Keir has ruled out is the idea of applying CGT on individuals’ main residences, which are currently exempt from CGT.

One point to note is that a leaked dossier from a select group of Labour MPs called the ‘Tribune’ group, reportedly includes a proposal to align CGT rates with income tax rates. This would likely increase headline CGT rates with the top rate of income tax currently set at 45%. However, Labour has stated that “none of this is Labour policy”3 and the document has been rejected.

What history can tell us (looking back over the last half a century) is that previous Labour governments have not looked to increase the headline rates of CGT during office, as the chart below demonstrates.

Changes in CGT rates per UK government

Corporation tax

Labour has pledged to cap corporation tax at the current level of 25% and will act if tax changes in other countries pose a risk to the UK’s competitiveness.

Stamp duty land tax (SDLT)

Labour has set out plans to increase the rate of SDLT paid by non-UK residents, from 2% to 3%. This would mean the top rate of SDLT applying to non-UK residents would increase from 17% to 18%.

Will Labour tax pensions

Pensions

Ahead of launching its manifesto, Labour announced that it will drop plans to reintroduce the lifetime allowance, a cap on how much people are allowed to save into their pensions before paying tax.

Importantly, Labour has committed to upholding the pensions triple lock, which ensures that the state pension will continue to increase each year in line with the highest of three factors: wage growth, inflation, or a minimum of 2.5%. This policy is designed to protect the purchasing power of retirees and ensure they are able to maintain a stable standard of living in retirement.

Labour has also previously stated that it will undertake a review of the pensions landscape to consider what further steps are needed to improve pension outcomes. However, further clarity on the scope of this review and the challenges they are looking to address is not yet available.

How to protect my pension from Labour?

We understand that planning your retirement is about more than money. Book a callback and let’s work together and build a plan that helps you achieve your goals and realise your ideas.

Other Labour policies and plans

VAT

The Labour manifesto confirms that it intends to introduce VAT on private school fees and will end business rates relief for the schools, with such measures estimated to raise around £1.5bn for the government. The VAT is not expected to be imposed until at least 2025, according to incoming Chancellor Rachel Reeves.

The delay until 2025 provides families with additional time to consider their options and improve their planning. Families typically have a finite number of financial planning levers that can be pulled in order to meet additional expenditure, namely reducing other expenditure, increasing earnings, targeting higher returns (with the additional risk that comes with this), looking to borrow and gifting from relatives.

National Insurance contributions

Labour supported the Conservatives’ cuts to National Insurance in the 2024 Spring Budget, and its manifesto outlines a commitment not to raise current rates. However, Labour may utilise fiscal drag with tax rates already being frozen until 2028.

Interestingly, the Conservatives pledged to abolish the main rate of National Insurance paid by the self-employed by 2029, but there has been no evidence to suggest Labour will follow this path.

The Labour manifesto also doesn’t rule out extending the scope of National Insurance to apply to all sources of income and to working pensioners (as suggested in the Tribune dossier).

Non-domiciled rules

Although Labour supports most aspects of the Conservatives’ proposed replacement of the nondomiciled rules, there is a notable exception to trust planning where they have stated they will “end the use of offshore trusts to avoid IHT so that everyone who makes their home here in the UK pays their taxes here”.

Some transitional provisions may not materialise, such as the 50% reduction in tax on non-UK income for the 2025/26 tax year. Whilst others may be introduced like encouraging UK investments and the remittance of non-UK income and gains to the UK.

Other planned changes look set to continue although the timing of their implementation may need to be adjusted in order to bolster both tax revenues and investment in the UK.

The impact of a Labour government on financial markets

The principal mechanisms through which politics impact markets is via interest rate expectations. If policies are perceived to be inflationary then interest rate expectations will increase. This would be reflected in higher yields on UK government bonds, which would in turn be reflected in higher fixed-term mortgage intertest rates. As a consequence, the pound would increase in value.

So far, the new government has suggested it will not spend lavishly, however its proposed spending commitments don’t seem to be covered by their published plans for increasing tax income. Therefore, Labour either needs to raise more taxes than it has committed to, spend less than pledged, or borrow more (which would see market interest rates effectively increase). Another path involves surprisingly strong growth that increases tax revenues without driving up inflation. While this would always be the preferred means of raising revenue, it is one few professional forecasters expect in this instance.

The immediate impact of a Labour government on financial markets has been apathy. Because the party was the clear favourite for such a long time, market interest rates and the pound effectively reflected the result weeks before it happened.

Markets will only react if something unexpected is announced. Most announcements that impact interest rates are made at budgets and governments have held the occasional emergency budget soon after taking power. Incoming Chancellor, Rachel Reeves has indicated that she will not do so. Instead, she could hold a budget in the autumn when convention dictates. We would then have a package of more concrete measures to indicate Labour’s spending and tax plans.

What will Labour do next?

As the new government assumes office, investors and businesses should stay informed and vigilant about any changes in the areas of taxation and investment. While there is always a degree of uncertainty surrounding any political transition, individuals can take proactive steps to protect their personal finances by staying up to date on any proposed policy changes.

What is Kamala Harris’ stance on the U.S. economy?

Investors seeking continuity in U.S. economic policy will find common ground with Vice President Kamala Harris. Her views align with President Biden’s approach on issues such as tariffs, tax, and spending. Environmental and green energy initiatives will remain a priority, while she would probably seek to raise taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals.

Our RBC colleagues in the U.S. highlight that Harris would lean slightly more towards the progressive wing of the party than Biden, who is known as a centrist. Indeed, Harris has said that building up the middle class will be the defining goal of her presidency. This may lead to greater emphasis on workers’ rights and union support, potentially prioritising them over business interests. She would also push for increased spending in areas like education, healthcare, affordable housing, and childcare.

It’s worth noting that many of the tax cuts signed into law by Donald Trump in 2018 expire at the end of next year. Like Biden, Harris has suggested she would favour making the tax cuts permanent for workers earning less than $400,000 per year, while reversing the cuts for higher income earners to pre-2018 levels.

Does Harris entering the race give the Democrats a better chance of winning?

In short, yes.

Trump has his hardcore supporters. But his broad appeal is limited, and his favourability rating remains fairly low. With the right candidate he is beatable, as was proved in 2020.

But is Harris the person to defeat Trump?

Replacing Biden certainly seems to have energised the party. Donations have surged. The money will go towards paying for the media time required to convince a now much larger group of undecided voters to vote for her.

The performance of the U.S. economy between now and election day (November 5) will be crucial for the Democrats. Americans have been dissatisfied with the economy, and much of that is is linked to inflation. The good news is that inflation has decelerated, with the annualised three-month rate of change of the U.S. core consumer price index – a key measure of changes in purchasing trends and inflation – now down to 2%. If the inflation numbers can remain subdued up to election day, this will help Harris.

However, Harris will need to change voters’ perceptions about her role in managing the high levels of illegal migration into the U.S. Several high-profile Republicans have branded her Biden’s “border czar”. Democrats would argue that this is an unfair label, as she was tasked with investigating the root causes of elevated levels of migration from Central America (the Homeland Security Secretary oversees the border). Another big flare up on the border with Mexico between now and the election will not help Harris’ cause.

What if Trump wins? How would his policies affect financial markets?

If Trump wins, his policies could significantly affect financial markets. He would seek to make permanent all of the 2018 tax cuts, including those for high earners, and likely try to lower the corporate tax rate from 21% to 15%. Trump would also reduce regulation, particularly in financial services and fossil fuel energy, and adopt a more business-friendly approach to antitrust than Harris. He is also likely to be much tougher on immigration.

On trade, Trump’s stance with China is a concern. He’s threatened a 60% tariff on imports from China, a substantial escalation from the 10% to 25% tariffs imposed in his first term.

Biden has also been tough on China, keeping many of his predecessor’s tariffs in place, as well as beefing up export controls and imposing new tariffs. We could expect more of the same if Harris wins, but it’s probably fair to assume that the U.S.’ relationship with China would be less volatile under her leadership than under Trump.

Where Harris and Trump really differ on trade policy is their treatment of other countries. Trump has threatened a tariff of 10% across the board, including on U.S. allies.

Trump’s agenda also includes several “non-standard” measures. He may seek to redesignate civil servants as political appointees, replacing perceived adversaries with loyalists. Trump has also vowed to bring regulatory agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission, under his authority. Finally, the risk of Trump attempting to influence monetary policy is much higher than it would be under Harris.

What about the U.S. government’s rising $35 trillion debt?

Under Trump, unfunded tax cuts were passed. Under Biden, unfunded spending has occurred. Yet neither Trump nor Harris see reducing the record $35 trillion debt as a priority. Nevertheless, absent a sharp economic slowdown, we doubt there is much scope for unfunded tax cuts or spending this time around.

The U.S. bond market could react negatively to excessive deficit growth (remember the reaction to Liz Truss’ mini-budget?), which politicians from both parties will want to avoid. Moreover, reducing the budget deficit has become more of a priority for Americans.

How important are the Congressional elections?

Despite the focus on the presidential election, voters will also be choosing new members of Congress (where laws are passed) when they fill their ballots.

The U.S. president has lots of scope to do as they please when it comes to trade and foreign policy, but laws on spending and taxation must be approved by both Chambers of Congress before being signed into law by the president. As such, if Trump or Harris win but their party does not control both the House of Representatives and the Senate, very little in the way of new legislation is likely to be passed, especially considering the deep divide between the Republicans and Democrats.

Even in a unified government, where the president and a majority of Congress are from the same party, not all of Trump or Harris’ policy agenda is likely to be implemented. This is because the race for the House of Representatives is likely to be close, and the winning party will have centrists unwilling to support the more extreme parts of the president’s policy agenda.

How will a Trump or Harris presidency affect investments?

Equity investors would likely welcome a deregulatory push, further corporate tax reduction, and making the 2018 tax cuts for high-income earners permanent, all of which could potentially be implemented under a Trump administration. However, the likely rise in trade uncertainty and the potential for an all-out global trade war would be a major turn-off.

Trump’s trade and immigration policies could also result in higher inflation and therefore more restrictive monetary policy than under Harris. His interference with the civil service and the Federal Reserve could also make equity investors somewhat uneasy.

While there are clearly moving parts, our sense is that the best result for equity investors would be a Harris win without Democrat control of Congress. In this scenario, the risk of a damaging global trade war drops sharply, but the Republicans would block any new proposed tax hikes from being legislated.

While politics and fiscal policy drive market direction, other variables including the stage of the economic cycle, monetary policy, sentiment, and valuations, are also key drivers of investment performance.

We continue to believe there is scope for global equities to keep moving higher. While economic growth is slowing, we suspect corporate profits will continue to advance over the medium term.

Likely to be the last major fiscal event before the next general election later in the year, UK chancellor, Jeremy Hunt has delivered his Spring Budget setting out the Treasury’s taxation and spending plans for the next financial year.

With an impetus on “more investment, more jobs, and lower taxes”, Hunt put tax cuts at the heart of his Budget in an attempt to lower the tax burden on individuals and boost long-term economic growth. Key announcements include cuts to national insurance, the introduction of a UK ISA, and the abolishment of the UK ‘non-dom’ tax system.

Hunt also provided updates on the outlook for UK inflation, with the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecasting inflation to fall below the government’s target of 2% by the end of May 2024[1].

The Spring Budget builds upon the 2023 Autumn Statement, in which Hunt announced cuts to national insurance, rises to the minimum and living wage, and a triple-lock boost to the state pension, among other measures. You can find a breakdown of the key changes in our 2023 Autumn Statement response.

Here, we dissect the key announcements of the Spring Budget relevant to personal finance and investments, before giving the views of Guy Foster, our Chief Strategist, on the implications for the UK economy.

Announcements:

Class 1 National Insurance contributions (NICs) will be cut from 10% to 8% from 6 April 2024.

In the Autumn Statement 2023, the government announced the removal of the requirement to pay Class 2 NICs from 6 April 2024 and committed to abolishing Class 2 entirely. The government will consult later in 2024 on how it will deliver Class 2 abolition.

Impact:

National Insurance contributions are paid by employees and the self-employed on their earnings, as well as employers. Currently, employees pay NI at 10% on earnings over £12,570 and at 2% on earnings over £50,268. Today’s announcement will see the headline rate of 10% lowered to 8%. This will result in anyone earning above £50,268 saving £754 in NI contributions each year.

Planning opportunities:

Your NI saving is money that was previously taxed, and so a ‘net new’ regular income. Placing it into a pension (where it benefits from tax relief) may increase your overall tax savings without affecting your current income.

Where possible you could consider deferring the extraction of income subject to NI (such as salary from a company) until the lower rate takes effect.

UK ISA introduced

Announcement:

The chancellor introduced a tax-free £5,000 UK ISA that can be used to invest in UK investments (a consultation has been launched to determine which investments would qualify).

Impact:

In an effort to revitalise the UK stock market, the UK ISA would likely enable investors to buy UK company shares without paying tax on income and gains. Savers will benefit from an extra £5,000 tax-free allowance per year.

Planning opportunities:

Many stocks and shares ISA holders will already invest in UK equities as part of their overall portfolio. Investors who hold UK equities outside of an ISA could (subject to eligibility and CGT considerations) move these into the new UK ISA to be held more tax efficiently, without committing additional sums to the markets.

ISAs remain a great tool for tax-efficient investing. Making full use of annual ISA allowances can be an effective way to build tax-efficient savings and while the details are to be confirmed, the UK ISA will provide another vehicle and additional allowance.

British savings bonds

Announcement:

Launch of a new NS&I product – British savings bonds. This product will be launched in April 2024 and will offer a guaranteed rate of interest which is fixed for three years.

Impact

This will increase the range of government backed savings products available under National Savings & Investments, which currently offers four ways to save (premium bonds, direct saver, income bonds and green savings bonds) as well as adult and child cash ISAs.

They will offer savers a guaranteed rate over three years for investments between £500 and £1million.

Planning opportunity:

NS&I savings products can offer attractive lower-risk returns (owing to the government backing) and should be considered as part of your plan, just as the existing NS&I products will. The British savings bond interest rate has not yet been announced and will be a key determining factor in the attractiveness of this product.

Capital gains tax on residential property

Announcement:

With effect from 6 April 2024, the higher rate of CGT for residential property disposals will be cut from 28% to 24%.

Impact:

This reduction in CGT rate aims to encourage landlords and second home-owners to sell their properties, thereby increasing housing availability for other potential homebuyers. The government estimates this will increase revenue by £690 million over the next five tax years.

Planning opportunity:

If you’re about to sell a second home, completing the transaction after 6 April 2024 could save you up to 4% of the taxable gain.

Furnished holiday lettings regime abolished

Announcement:

From 6 April 2025, the tax regime around furnished holiday lets will be abolished and they will be treated the same as long term lets for tax purposes.

Impact: Furnished holiday lets benefit from more generous tax treatment in comparison to other let properties, such as:

Profits are treated as relevant earnings for pension contribution relief (i.e. treated the same way as employment and self-employment income).

There are more generous deductions in arriving at taxable profit, including 100% of interest on mortgages and capital allowances.

Potential 10% capital gains tax (CGT) rate on the property’s sale through business asset disposal relief (known as entrepreneurs’ relief before 2020).

Rollover relief if you are reinvesting the proceeds to buy a new holiday home or investing in certain qualifying properties (or the replacement of business assets) for CGT purposes.

Holdover relief (on gifts) for CGT purposes, which result in the recipient paying CGT only when the property was sold in future.

Losses can be offset against future furnished holiday let profits and in certain circumstances, against other types of income.

Planning opportunities:

This is a large change in the tax treatment of short-term furnished lets and could tilt the scales on whether the property is profit or loss making. It is important to understand how these changes will affect the tax amount due and to assess the profitability of such investments going forwards.

Many individuals looked to transfer properties into companies following changes to tax on longer-term lettings and this may be worth exploring on furnished holiday lets too. Depending on the position, it may even be worth considering whether funds should be redeployed in other investment classes.

UK non-dom tax status abolished and replaced with a new regime

Announcements:

From 6 April 2025, the current remittance basis of taxation will be abolished for UK resident non-domiciled individuals (non-doms).

From 6 April 2025, this method of taxation will be replaced by a new regime for individuals who become a UK tax resident (after a period of 10 tax years of non-residence). Eligible individuals will not pay tax on foreign income or gains in the first four tax years of UK residency and will be able to bring these funds to the UK free from any additional charges.

Overseas Workday Relief (OWR) for the first three tax years of UK residence will be retained for income from employment duties carried out overseas, whether or not these earnings are brought to the UK.

The government has announced the intention to move to a residence-based regime for inheritance tax (IHT) and will consult in due course on the best way to achieve this. No changes to IHT will take effect before 6 April 2025.

Impact:

UK residents whose permanent home (domicile) is outside of the UK currently only pay UK tax on income and gains generated in the UK, not outside the UK (unless they bring it into the UK). In addition, non-UK assets are outside the UK IHT net.

There were 68,800 non-doms in the UK for the tax year ending 2022 according to HMRC[2], and these individuals will have to pay UK tax on their overseas income and gains from 6 April 2025 if they arrived in the UK before 6 April 2022.

The new regime will offer a simpler albeit shorter “tax holiday” on foreign income or gains. Importantly, in a large shift from the current regime, these gains or income will be able to be brought into the UK free from tax.

Planning opportunities:

Those looking to move to the UK should seek professional tax advice prior to moving to ensure they understand the tax implications.

For those currently in the UK, the planning window within the current regime is limited. Understanding the impact of the changes alongside your options with an appropriate professional could help you make proactive choices to navigate and take advantage of the upcoming changes. In this regard, the transitional arrangements may provide opportunities.

Transitional arrangements for existing “non-doms”

Announcement:

Non-doms who will lose access to the remittance basis on 6 April 2025 and are not eligible for the new four-year regime, will receive a single-tax-year (6 April 2025 to 5 April 2026) exemption of 50% on the taxation of foreign income.

Current non-doms who have claimed the remittance basis will be able to re-base capital assets to 5 April 2019 levels for disposals that take place after 6 April 2025. This means that when foreign assets are disposed of, affected individuals can elect to be taxed only on capital gains since that date.

Non-doms will be able to remit foreign income and gains that arose before 6 April 2025 to the UK at a flat rate of 12% under a new Temporary Repatriation Facility in the tax years 2025/26 and 2026/27.

From 6 April 2025, all foreign income and gains arising within a settlor interested trust (where the settlor is also a named beneficiary) will be taxable on the settlor, unless the settlor is able to benefit from the new four-year regime. Pre-6 April 2025 income and gains will not be taxed unless distributions or benefits are paid to UK residents who have been here for more than four years.

Impact:

For current non-doms who will stay in the UK, the transitional arrangements offer some significant, albeit time-limited, potential benefits. Taking advantage of these may help lessen the future impact of the upcoming changes.

Planning opportunities:

Those wishing to spend foreign income or gains in the UK should look to take advantage of the time-limited opportunity to bring these in at a 12% tax rate. The amount brought into the UK should reflect what is required and take into account wider planning.

Individuals able to control the timing of their income may wish to consider realising foreign income in the 2025/26 tax year. Those that are eligible for rebasing will likely want to obtain valuations of assets as at 5 April 2019 in order to compare to the original base cost.

When a similar transitional relief was introduced in 2017 an opportunity for creating additional clean capital arose. Those considering a trust may wish to take these changes into account. Those with existing trusts should review the suitability of these and consider whether additional structuring may be required, such as international bonds, private funds and companies.

Crypto assets

Announcement: The government will launch a consultation on crypto-asset reporting.

Impact

A consultation will be launched on crypto-asset reporting and amendments to the Common Reporting Standard (the system whereby financial institutions share information directly with tax authorities). This intends to close gaps in the tax transparency system that have emerged as a result of recent developments in financial technology and the global crypto-asset market.

The announcement follows the recent (November 2023) launch of a campaign and specific facility to report previously unpaid taxes on crypto assets.

Planning opportunity:

If you are unsure of how your crypto assets should be taxed, please speak with your tax adviser and ensure that all tax is reported and paid.

Child benefit threshold raised

Announcement:

From April 2024, the £50,000 high-income child benefit charge threshold will be raised to £60,000 and the taper will extend up to £80,000.

A consultation will be launched to extend the charge to a household basis (from the current individual basis) by April 2026.

Impact:

At £50,000, an individual starts to pay a higher rate tax of 40% but is also subject to a high-income child benefit charge (effectively a claw back of child benefit). This threshold has been static since 2013 and so its increase will help individuals who have been affected by fiscal drag.

Currently, if one partner earns more than £50,000, child benefit is gradually withdrawn and where earnings are £60,000 or more, they do not receive any child benefit at all. This means two parents earning, say £49,000 a year each, would receive child benefit in full. In comparison, a household with one working parent or a single-income household earning more than £50,000 would have their benefit cut. The change to a household basis being consulted on will look to end the unfairness by looking at the household rather than individual level.

Planning opportunities

As the charge is currently based on each individual’s income rather than household income, it may be possible to reduce the impact by distributing income between spouses differently. However, this may change in future following the consultation to look at the household level.

The timing of gifts to charity or the quantity of pension contributions can also impact the level of charge and should be considered.

The individual registering for child benefit should also be carefully considered as NI contribution credits (i.e. state pension accrual where there is little/no income) will be awarded to the person registered for child benefit.

Following the introduction of the household basis it may be appropriate to consider planning for both partners (such as pension contributions) to reduce the overall household income and maximise child benefits.

Stamp duty

Announcement:

From 1 June 2024, the government is abolishing multiple dwellings relief for stamp duty land tax (SDLT).

Impact

Multiple Dwellings Relief (MDR) is a tax relief that can be claimed against Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) when a purchaser buys more than one residential dwelling in a single, or linked, transaction. When claimed, MDR causes the SDLT owed to broadly align with what would have been payable had the properties been purchased individually in separate transactions.

Property transactions with contracts that were exchanged on or before 6 March 2024 will continue to benefit from the relief regardless of when they complete, as will any other purchases that are completed before 1 June 2024. This follows an external evaluation which showed no strong evidence the relief is meeting its original objectives of supporting investment in the private rented sector. This change is expected to be worth £385m a year from 2028/29.

Planning opportunity

There is a time limited window to take advantage of Multiple Dwellings Relief so it is worth considering expediting any qualifying transactions where possible and working with your tax adviser to understand the implications of the upcoming removal of the relief.

The economy

Commenting on the outlook for the UK economy, Guy Foster, chief strategist at RBC Brewin Dolphin, said:

“The Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast that UK GDP growth is expected to recover modestly in 2024 and more significantly in 2025. This follows two years of economic activity weighed down by inflation and rising interest rates. The economy entered recession, but it was a technical recession, which may yet be revised away as inflation has fallen faster than had been anticipated whilst employment remains strong.

Against this backdrop, the political necessity of cutting taxes ahead of an election met the economic reality of having relatively little scope to do so. Signs of largesse in this budget could be self-defeating if markets feared a return of inflation, as it would cause mortgage rates to rise.

A reduction in national insurance will boost the incomes of the vast majority of employees, albeit quite modestly for many. However, those giveaways should be seen in the context of frozen tax thresholds that have pushed many taxpayers into higher tax rates.”

Looking to the future

The Spring Budget could be the Conservatives’ last fiscal event before an election and were there to be a change in government later this year, the new ruling party would surely set about putting their own stamp on the country’s finances.

For individuals navigating the impact of these ever-changing rules on their financial plans, diversity in the structures in which they hold wealth is important. As we’ve seen with ISAs this year and pensions in 2022, changes in rules may favour one structure over another, so remaining diverse in your allocation allows for an adaptable plan.

For those seeking to manage this impact, there remains a range of tools available; from ISAs and pensions to international bonds and family investment vehicles, as well as a number of schemes that reduce tax liabilities such as Enterprise Investment Schemes and Venture Capital Trusts.
